# Face Detection Using OpenCV and Python

This project is an example of using OpenCV and Python for real-time face detection. Using computer vision algorithms,
the application is able to identify and locate faces in images or video streams. 
The project was developed with knowledge acquired from tutorials and resources like GeeksforGeeks, W3Schools, and YouTube.


## Technologies Used

- Python: This is the programming language used for developing the application.
- OpenCV: This is a powerful library that is primarily used for computer vision tasks, including face detection.
- Haar Cascade Classifier: This tool is used in order to detect faces within an image or video stream.

# Features

- Real-Time Face Detection: Real-time face detection from a webcam or video stream.
- Haar Cascade Classifier: Uses pre-trained classifier for high accuracy.
- Image/Video Input: Accepts input from both images and video streams.
- Bounding Boxes: Draws bounding boxes around the faces for highlighting purposes.

## Resources

- [GeeksforGeeks OpenCV Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [W3Schools Python OpenCV Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- YouTube tutorials that helped in building this project.

## Future Enhancements

- Multiple face detection: Extend the project to handle multiple faces in the same image.
- Emotion Detection: Add emotion recognition with face detection.
- GUI Interface: Create a simple GUI to make the application user-friendly.
